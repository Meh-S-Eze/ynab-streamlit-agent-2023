Project Overview
Create a focused Vue.js application that integrates with the YNAB (You Need A Budget) API. The app will have three primary functions:
Allow users to set and update their YNAB API token
Select which YNAB budget to work with
Provide a natural language chatbot interface for interacting with YNAB data
Reference Implementation
Use the existing implementation as a reference:
Core Architecture
Follow a "Core-First" development approach with these key components:
Core Layer (Most Important)
API Client: YNAB API integration with proper authentication and error handling
NLP Service: Process natural language queries for financial operations
Token Management: Secure storage and management of the YNAB API token
Budget Selection: Fetch and manage available budgets
Interface Layer
Simple Vue.js UI with three main views:
API token configuration
Budget selection
Natural language chatbot interface
Key Features to Implement
API Token Management
Input field for entering YNAB API token
Secure storage of the token (localStorage with encryption or similar)
Validation of token before saving
Option to clear/reset token
Budget Selection
Fetch available budgets once token is configured
Allow user to select which budget to work with
Save budget selection preference
Display current budget name in the interface
Natural Language Chatbot
Chat-like interface for entering natural language queries
Support for transaction-related queries:
Creating transactions (e.g., "I spent $45.99 at Amazon last week")
Searching transactions (e.g., "Show my grocery spending last month")
Getting budget information (e.g., "How much do I have left in my dining budget?")
Display formatted responses from YNAB
Show error messages for invalid queries or API issues
API Integration
Connect to YNAB API using the provided token
YNAB API base URL: https://api.youneedabudget.com/v1
Handle authentication errors gracefully
Implement basic error handling and retries
Process API responses into user-friendly formats
Technical Requirements
Frontend (Vue.js)
Vue 3 with Composition API
Simple, focused component architecture
Responsive design for mobile and desktop
Form validation for the API token
Loading states during API calls
Error handling with user-friendly messages
Natural Language Processing
Parse user queries to extract key information:
Transaction amounts
Payees/merchants
Dates and time periods
Categories
Convert parsed information into appropriate YNAB API calls
Format API responses into readable chat messages
Data Security
Don't send the API token to any third-party services
Implement basic encryption for token storage
Allow users to easily clear their token
Implementation Notes
Keep the UI minimal and focused on the three main functions
Prioritize user experience in the chatbot interface
Provide clear feedback for successful/failed operations
Include helpful examples of queries users can try
Implement proper error messages for common issues
Ensure the selected budget is used for all API operations
Vue-Specific Implementation Details
Use Vue 3's Composition API for better code organization
Create a simple three-view layout (token config, budget selection, and chat)
Implement a chat-like component for the natural language interface
Use Vue's transition system for smooth message animations
Store API token and budget selection securely using Vue's reactivity system
Design Guidelines
Clean, minimalist interface
Conversational UI for the chatbot
Clear distinction between user queries and system responses
Intuitive token configuration and budget selection screens
Mobile-friendly design
Display current budget name prominently in the chat interface
This focused application provides a simple way for users to interact with their YNAB data using natural language, with minimal setup requiring only their API token and budget selection.
