    "Create a `core/` directory containing financial operations, API interactions, and calculations. Implement CLI and GUI interfaces that import and utilize this core module. This reduces code duplication and maintains a single source of truth. Leverage dependency injection (@rule-dependency-injection) to allow core components to interact with specific data sources provided by the GUI/CLI."
