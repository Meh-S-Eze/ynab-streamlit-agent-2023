Prompt 1: Architecture and Component Overview
Focus on the high-level architecture, component interactions, and system design. Request:
	•	Three-tier architecture diagram
	•	Component interaction flows
	•	Data flow between YNAB API, MCP layer, and user interfaces
	•	Overview of key technologies and their roles
Prompt 2: YNAB API and MCP Integration
Focus on the specific integration between YNAB API and MCP:
	•	Authentication and session management
	•	Handling YNAB API complexities (obtaining payee IDs, category IDs)
	•	MCP resource mapping to YNAB entities
	•	Sample code for key API integration points
Prompt 3: Pydantic AI Implementation
Focus specifically on how to leverage Pydantic AI:
	•	Schema definitions for YNAB data
	•	Type enforcement strategies
	•	Integration patterns with MCP
	•	Model designs for command processing
Prompt 4: Natural Language CLI Interface
Focus on the command-line interface:
	•	Command parsing strategies with LangChain
	•	Sample command schema design
	•	Error handling for misinterpreted commands
	•	Examples of supported natural language commands
Prompt 5: Streamlit Chat Integration
Focus on the Streamlit chat functionality:
	•	Chat interface design
	•	Integration with the NLP layer
	•	User interaction patterns
	•	Session management within Streamlit
Prompt 6: Logging Implementation
Focus on the comprehensive logging approach:
	•	Logging patterns for different components
	•	Debug vs. audit logging strategies
	•	Tools and libraries for effective logging
	•	Example logging configurations
Benefits of This Approach
By breaking down the prompt as suggested:
	1.	Each response can provide more detailed implementation guidance
	2.	You’ll receive more thorough code examples for each component
	3.	The AI can focus on specific technical challenges rather than trying to address everything at once
	4.	You can process the prompts in an order that matches your development priorities
	5.	You’ll get more comprehensive answers that don’t sacrifice detail due to length constraints
This approach also allows you to iteratively refine your implementation plan as you receive responses to each prompt, potentially asking follow-up questions based on the information provided.
