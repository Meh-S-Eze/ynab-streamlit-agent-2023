NEVER ACCESS ANDY BUDGETS EXCEPT YNAB_BUDGET_DEV=7c8d67c8-ed70-4ba8-a25e-931a2f294167

DO NOT EVER ACCESS OTHER BUDGETS OR MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO CODE THAT WOULD ACCESS OTHERS OR RUN TERMINAL COMMANDS OR CULRS THAT WOULD ACCESS OTHERS.


ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES:
------------------------
1. CORE-FIRST DEVELOPMENT:
   - Core logic resides in core/ directory
   - CLI and Streamlit serve as thin access layers
   - Core logic should never import from interface layers

2. PYDANTIC AI INTEGRATION:
   - Use Pydantic BaseModel for all data structures
   - Follow the Agent pattern with structured input/output 
   - Define clear tool functions with comprehensive docstrings
   - Use dependency injection pattern for services
   - Create standalone Agents for specific tasks (transactions, categories, analysis)

3. YNAB API BEST PRACTICES:
   - Implement caching for all API responses (@lru_cache where appropriate)
   - Use delta requests when available to reduce API load
   - Implement circuit breakers for fault tolerance
   - Make specific targeted requests rather than broad ones
   - Handle rate limiting and API errors gracefully

4. NATURAL LANGUAGE TESTING:
   - Test through CLI natural language queries
   - Document example queries for each feature
   - Log comprehensive debugging information
   - Create standard test scenarios to validate functionality
   - Preserve test examples in documentation

5. AI MODEL MANAGEMENT:
   - Centralize prompt management
   - Document system prompts with examples
   - Use consistent temperature settings per task type
   - Implement proper error handling for model responses
   - Extract and validate JSON responses robustly

6. ERROR HANDLING & LOGGING:
   - Log at appropriate levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)
   - Include context variables in log messages
   - Provide user-friendly error messages
   - Implement graceful fallbacks for AI components
   - Use circuit breakers for external services

7. ENVIRONMENT & CONFIGURATION:
   - Use environment variables for all configuration
   - Support separate development and production environments
   - Document required environment variables
   - Provide sensible defaults where possible
   - Validate configuration on startup
